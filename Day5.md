#                     Screen Printing


### _Screen printing is a printing technique whereby a mesh is used to transfer ink onto a substrate, except in areas made impermeable to the ink by a blocking stencil.A blade or squeegee is moved across the screen to fill the open mesh apertures with ink, and a reverse stroke then causes the screen to touch the substrate momentarily along a line of contact. This causes the ink to wet the substrate and be pulled out of the mesh apertures as the screen springs back after the blade has passed._

### _Screen printing is also a stencil method of print making in which a design is imposed on a screen of polyester or other fine mesh, with blank areas coated with an impermeable substance.Ink is forced into the mesh openings by the fill blade or squeegee and by wetting the substrate, transferred onto the printing surface during the squeegee stroke. As the screen rebounds away from the substrate the ink remains on the substrate. It is also known as silk-screen, screen, serigraphy, and serigraph printing.One color is printed at a time, so several screens can be used to produce a multicoloured image or design._

####  1.Designing the model.The 2D design of the model was developed using CutStudio.
    
####  2.Cutting using Vinyl cutter and Pasting, after creating holes, the stencil is pasted on to the screen.
  
####  3.Wiping Process.
