## FAB LAB


<img src="fablab.jpg">
    Fab labs provide widespread access to modern means for invention. They began as an outreach project from MIT's Center for Bits and    Atoms (CBA), and became into a collaborative and global network. You can find more information about Fab Labs on the Fab Foundation   Website. The annotated photo below illustrates the facilities of a typical Fab Lab.
