    ### _3D D Printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a physical object from a digital design.
    There are different 3D printing technologies and materials you can print with,
    but all are based on the same principle: a digital model is turned into a solid three-dimensional
    physical object by adding material layer by layer._
